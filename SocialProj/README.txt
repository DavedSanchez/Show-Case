Social Project:
	Description:
		First time connection to a MySQL database using C# in the back-end
		Front-End is XMAL
		Learning how MySQL Commands would get executed through C# code
			have live updates when images and colour schemes are changed

NOTE:
	Will not be able to run since it requires a MySQL database connection, and my local machine is the 'database'
